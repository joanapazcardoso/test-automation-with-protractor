## Lesson 4 - Writing your first test

Have your heard of [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io), the unit testing library?

So, Protractor uses Jasmine as its default testing library, which means that the structure and syntax is basically the same.

First, you start a test suite, which uses the `describe()` function.

The `describe()` function receives a string as its first argument (e.g., `'my app'`) and a callback function as its second argument.

Inside of the `describe`'s callback function, tests are written in `it()` functions.

Similar to the `describe()` function, `it()` functions also receives a string as its first argument (e.g., `'test login with success'`) and a callback function as its second argument.

Then, the tests logic are written inside of the `it`'s callback function.

## Exersice

Inside of the `specs/login.spec.js` file, create the basic structure to test the successful login scenario.

🕵🏻‍♀️ Here's a hint.

```js
// specs/login.spec.js

describe('Login', function() {
  it('logs in successfully', function() {

  })
})
```

Go to the terminal inside of this project's root directory and run `npx webdriver-manager update && npx protractor conf.js`.

```sh
Started
.


1 spec, 0 failures
Finished in 0.165 seconds

[01:25:57] I/launcher - 0 instance(s) of WebDriver still running

```

Tada! 🎉 You have your first passing test!

Yeah, I know there's no test implemented yet, but it feels good to see it passing. Don't you feel that?

Alright, now you need to learn a few of Protractor functionalities.

First, to visit a web page by its relative URL (since we already have the `baseUrl` defined in the config file) Protractor uses `browser.get('/some-relative-url')`.

Secondly, to locate HTML elements, Protractor can use a few strategies. Let's see some of them.

```js
const iAmATextInputWithAnId = element(by.id('my-id'))
const iAmAnElementWithAClass = element(by.className('some-class'))
const iAmASubmitButton = element(by.css('button[type="submit"]'))
const iAmAHeadingWithASpecificText = element(by.cssContainingText('h1', 'I am a heading, yay!'))
```

Thirdly, to interact with the located elements, Protractor have many different methods. Let's explore a couple of them.

```js
// This is how Protractor simulates a user typing in a text input field (or a text area)
iAmATextInputWithAnId.sendKeys('Hi!')

// And this is how Protractor clicks on elements such as buttons, links, etc.
iAmASubmitButton.click()
```

It's your turn.

> Go to `https://notes-serverless-app.com/signup` and create an account so that you can use the created user for the `logs in successfully` test.

Then, implement the logic of the test so that it will visit the `/login` relative URL, it will locate the right element, and it will fill the form and submit.

Finally, run test (`npx protractor conf.js`).
